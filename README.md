# Handwritten-Digit-Classifier-Neural-Networks-MNIST-Dataset-
Handwritten Digit Classifier using MNIST dataset. Built and compared three models: simple NN without normalization (~37% accuracy), with normalization (~92%), and deeper NN with hidden layers (~97%). Highlights the impact of preprocessing and architecture on model performance.
